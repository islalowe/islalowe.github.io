## Coding and Hobbies

I enjoy coding projects that solve problems that I want to be solved in my daily life. My other hobbies involve outdoor sports like climbing and snowboarding, which I enjoy because of the skill and creativity involved.

## Career Goals

I am a student at Seattle Pacific University with goals to work in encrypted satellite communication, and with an interest in creative start-ups.
